# Titanic_Survival_Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel-related features. This notebook uses classic classification models and includes feature engineering, EDA, and model evaluation.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset and applies classification models to predict survival. We implemented:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (like extracting titles and family size)
- Model training with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression
- Cross-validation and evaluation metrics
- Model saving with `pickle`
